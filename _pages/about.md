I am a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder, pursuing a master's thesis in Aerospace Engineering with a focus on autonomous systems. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering from the Maharashtra Institute of Technology in India.

My research interests lie in the intersection of human-robot interaction and motion planning.
